Walkr allows to use a markup language that is modified HTML.
W3 School is a great start point to learn basic HTML. 

Here is link to the school where you can also experiment with HTML for text formatting:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp

Be aware that not everything will work in walkr, and some known limitations will be described below.

Walkr HTML - working tags
walkr doesn't use <font> HTML tag, so we need to change font color and size explicitly. 
All tags require closing paired tags. Again you can see the output in HTML when experimenting inW3school.  

Some text effects that works:
- <i> - Italic text. Example <i> test </i>
- <b> - Bold text. Example <b> test </b>

Change of color
Walkr will accept color standard HTML names as well as hex codes.
Again, W3school is a great source to learn about coloring in HTML 

However, <font> or <h> or <p> tags are not recognised by walkr, thus you need to use walkr specific <color> tag with closing paired </color>.

example with named color: 
<color=red> Hello </color>

example with color hex code:
<color=#c6a2d5>Hello</color>

color picker:

color fading
great tool for generating html code for gradient & color fading effect:
http://patorjk.com/text-color-fader/
There is an example below for 1 liner banner. I also wrapped it in itallic <i> tag and added emoji at the end. 

Example: Impressive 1-liner with fading colors

<div>
<span style="color:#c6a2d5;">H</span><span style="color:#b3acd4;">e</span><span style="color:#a0b7d3;">l</span><span style="color:#8cc1d2;">l</span><span style="color:#79cbd1;">o</span><span style="color:#7dccc2;"> </span><span style="color:#81ceb4;">f</span><span style="color:#84cfa5;">r</span><span style="color:#88d096;">o</span><span style="color:#9dc397;">m</span><span style="color:#b3b598;"> </span><span style="color:#c8a899;">O</span><span style="color:#dd9a9a;">l</span><span style="color:#dd8d9b;">l</span><span style="color:#dd819d;">e</span><span style="color:#dc749e;">y</span><span style="color:#dc679f;"> </span></div>

1. Delete <div> and closing </div> tags
2. for each <span style="color:#..> tag do following:
	1. remove span style=" and make color:#c6a2d5;" as color=#c6a2d5. No quotes or semicolon needed
	2. change </span> closing tag to </color> closing tag
3. end result:

<I><color=#c6a2d5>H</color><color=#b3acd4>e</color><color=#a0b7d3>l</color><color=#8cc1d2>l</color><color=#79cbd1>o</color><color=#7dccc2> </color><color=#81ceb4>f</color><color=#84cfa5>r</color><color=#88d096>o</color><color=#9dc397>m</color><color=#b3b598> </color><color=#c8a899>O</color><color=#dd9a9a>l</color><color=#dd8d9b>l</color><color=#dd819d>e</color><color=#dc749e>y</color><color=#dc679f> </color></I>❤️

Change of font size
<font> or <h> or <p> tags are not recognised by walkr, thus you need to use walkr specific <size> tag with closing paired </size>.
You can also enlarge emoji as they are treated as text.

Example: <size=55> 🐬🌊🏄🏻‍♀️⚡️✨🇦🇺</size>

Special characters and symbols:
There are plenty of special characters and symbols that you can add to your banners. I could just copy them directly without using their codes:
- symbols https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_symbols.asp
- dingbats : https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_dingbats.asp
I found not of them visible in epic chats, so you need to test how they will appear in lab chat when your banner is ready.

Example: My first 3 lines banner with special characters

Walkr is not very good with wrapping words around and aligning lines with space, so I had to add black dots to align my banner.
Here is result of my experiment:

<color=#38d1b0> <size=25> ╭ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ╮                     
    <color=black>.  </color> Energy from Olley<size=55> 🐬🌊🏄🏻‍♀️⚡️✨🇦🇺</size>                  
</size> <color=black>.</color><size=25> ╰ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ≈ ╯</size></color> 

Walkr HTML limitations
There are some known walkr limitations (iOS walkr versions):
- break lines are not interpreted, so if you try to use <br/> to make a new line in your banner, it won't work and <br/> will appear in the end result of your banner
- as mentioned above, <font>, <p>, <h> tags are not recognised in walkr
- css styling is also not working in my experience
